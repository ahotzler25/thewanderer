  storyText: 'You enter a forest, fascinated by something you can''t articulate.
    After walking for an hour, the old oak and pine trees block out the night sky.
    Ahead of you is a wide clearing where a glowing, blue orb sits on a rotting tree
    stump. Do you . . .


    1. Enter the clearing and walk towards glowing orb.

    2.
    Turn around and leave the forest.'
