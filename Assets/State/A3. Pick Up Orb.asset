  storyText: "You pick up the orb gently with cupped hands. It's surprisingly warm.
    Bushes rustle behind you. The longer you stare into the orb, the more it feels
    a part of you. The orb is fairly translucent and you see black symbols inside.
    You hear a howl behind you, followed by a second, and you know you're not alone.
    Do you . . . \n\n1. Turn and fight.\n2. Drop the orb and run away."
