  storyText: "Two direwolves with matted, white hair emerge from the path you came
    from; you sense they had been stalking you. It's difficult to accurately gauge
    their size, but you know they stand taller than other wolves you've encountered.
    They separate and flank you, but the orb glows brighter. The wolves keep their
    distance, even backing up as the light expands towards them. Do you . . . \n\n1.
    Walk forward with the orb.\n2. Draw your sword."
