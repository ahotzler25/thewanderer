  storyText: "You take a small step towards one wolf and it recoils from the light,
    baring its teeth. You look over your shoulder. As it launches into the air, you
    hold the orb up between you and the wolf. You close your eyes, grip the orb tight
    so all your blood drains from your hand when you hear an ear-splitting scream.
    You open your eyes to see the wolf's body burn away. The other wolf, panicking
    and angry, rushes you, and you switch the orb to your left hand and watch as
    the second wolf disintegrates before in the same way. Do you . . . \n\n1. Catch
    your breath and study the orb.\n2. Curse and run screaming from the forest."
