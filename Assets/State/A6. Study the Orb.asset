  storyText: "The orb pulsates in your left hand, growing slightly colder. The black
    symbols inside swirl as if the orb was an all-seeing crystal ball, but no new
    shapes appear. At least none that you recognize. The wolves are nothing but two
    piles of greyish ash, nothing to loot or harvest. You look back at the orb unable
    to process how this orb came to be in this forest or what it even is. Do you
    . . . \n\n1. Shake the orb.\n2. Take rocky path that leads further into the forest."
