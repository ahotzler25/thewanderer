  storyText: 'You shake the orb and it heats immediately, burning the palm of your
    left hand. You swap it between your hands quickly, back and forth, as to not
    burn yourself. You begin to panic, almost unable to breathe not knowing what
    will happen if you drop it. You swallow hard. After swapping it back and forth
    carefully for ten seconds, it begin to cool and very slowly returns to the dimmed
    glow in which you found it, though the shapes look a more menacing black than
    before. It definitely scares you, but also fascinates you. You know there''s
    something miraculous here, but it will take time to understand it. Do you . .
    .


    1. Shake it again.

    2. Take the rocky path in front of you deeper
    into the forest.'
