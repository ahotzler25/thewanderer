  storyText: 'You hear distant howls behind you on the same path the wolves stalked
    you on. For fear of running into more, you walk north onto the rocky path.


    Holding
    the orb in front of you, the woods aren''t as dark as before. You look up and
    can see slivers of the sky through the trees. The tree canopy seems to slightly
    open above the path so that a thin line of moonlight illuminates the path. A
    feeling of security slowly comes over you after seeing what the orb did to the
    wolves.


    1. Continue.'
