  storyText: "You walk for a mile, two miles. You seem to have lost track, listening
    to the howls behind you, hearing every twig snap. The path winds around trees
    that may be hundreds of years old, trucks large enough to drive a carriage through.
    You see a shadow move to your left, and it's not the first time you thought you've
    seen it. Every time you think you see it, it melts into the shadows. Unease grows
    as the orb begins to shake in your palm. You walk a little faster, unsure of
    where the path leads. You see another shadow move. Do you . . . \n\n1. Call out.\n2.
    Run down the path."
