  storyText: 'You''re either too adventurous or haven''t adventured enough. The black
    symbols swirl inside, swimming around the sides as if they were trying to escape.
    It burned as fierce as the middle of a blacksmith''s fire. You had no time to
    react before it seared your palm, skin sizzling, and instinctively you dropped
    the orb. The last thing you hear is shattering glass, and when you look, black
    shapes shoot from the orb and spin around your face. As soon as you swing at
    a shape, it dives inside your mouth and everything goes black.


    1. Restart
    your adventure.'
